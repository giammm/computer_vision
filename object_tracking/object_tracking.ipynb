        "  - we have the first frame, which is the initialization or the definition of the object to be detected\n",
        "  - when working with videos, we use the first frame to select the object we want to track\n",
        "  - then the algorithm applies a concept called **particle filter** so that two additional larger bounding boxes are created to cover a large part of the image\n",
        "  - next, in the two next frames, the largest bounding box is used in order to adjust the frame in the central parts of the face. so the filter is updated\n",
        "  - so in the next frames, the second largest (the additional) bounding box is used and it is updated to center the position of the face\n",
        "  - then, in the next frame the same is done for the original bounding box\n",
        "  - the goal of the algorithm is to make several adjustments in these bounding boxes\n",
        "  - the larger BB that were automaticallly generated are important to detect changes in the scale or the size of the object. like a person approaching the camera"
